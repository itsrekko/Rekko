## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following software with the specified versions, as mentioned below, need to be installed:
<li> Node.js </li>
<li> React </li>
<li> Express </li>
<li> Mongo </li>
<li> Heroku </li>

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running. Please run all the commands from app directory:

1. git clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mohaimenhasan/Rekko.git
```
2. Create a mongoDB account and set up a DB (for testing and deployment)
3. Add the following configurations in a .env file on the main directory
```
MONGO_URI=<add your mongoDB URL here>
NODE_ENV=development/production (remember production would require https)
```
4. Install all the packages:
```
npm install (on the main directory)
cd/client/
npm install
```
5. If you want to run the app on development mode:

- For backend run the main server on nodemon: ``` npm run dev ``` (server runs on localhost 8888)
- For frontend run the client app: ```cd client && npm start``` (frontend app runs on localhost 3000)
6. If you want to have a production build:
```
cd client
npm run build
```
7. Start the server:
```
npm start.
```
Your app will be running on localhost:8888

## Deployment

To deploy it on heroku please sign in and request for access for the app: 
https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/2687c3fb-6687-4b9c-b090-6000e5aa41d3

Live App Deployed at: https://www.rekko.co/

### Guidelines:
- Don't push to main. Create a PR and an associated app would automatically be available for you on the heroku pipeline
- Once you get atleast one approval, merge your code. Dev pipeline should automatically pick it up
- Promote the changes to staging and then to prod from heroku UI

## Built With

* MERN Framework
* Heroku

Built as a monolith. We plan on shifting to a microservice architecture in the future
